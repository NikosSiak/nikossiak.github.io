            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                RetroPlayer is a new player core for Kodi Entertainment Center. It is similar to the video and audio players, but it
                plays games instead of movies and music. 
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Kodi excels at managing large movie, music, and (with add-ons) game libraries. 
                However, save states are simply stored next to the ROM or in a hard-coded folder.
                My project for the summer of 2020 was to create a save state manager for RetroPlayer.
                As a stretch goal, I had to implement automatic saved game captioning that gives saves a description
                of what the player is currently doing in their game.
            </p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The biggest challenge I faced was building Kodi addons because I didn't know how to use cmake.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The save state's thumbnail also got me stuck for a few days, more on this later.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Another big challenge was that I had to modify existing code that I had never seen before.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Work</h2>
            <h3>Save state Manager</h3>
            <p>
                I started by replacing the current dialog that was displaying when the user selected a rom, that was
                asking to select the game client that you want to use and deleted your save when you selected a
                different
                game client than the one which created the save state, with a dialog that displays all the saves from the
                selected game and extracted the game client's id from the selected save.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next I had to change how save states were saved, because the current way saved them next to the rom with
                the same name.
                In a conversation I had with Nick Renieris (velocity), my mentor, we decided not to use a database for
                the save states but use the filesystem to organize them. Now when the user launches a new game (rom) a
                subfolder with the rom's name will be created in a subfolder for saves in Kodi's home folder.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this point I had a working demo next step was to save the games current frame to use it as a
                thumbnail in the manager. This was the first challenge I faced, my first implementation took me about a week and it seemed to be 
                working but then I found out it was working only with specific game clients, those that are using 
                <span class="code">AV_PIX_FMT_BGR0</span> pixel format. Thankfully velocity came in with a solution to change the output 
                pixel format in the ffmpeg <span class="code">SwsContext</span> when we scale the image.
            </p>

            <div class="code-link">
                <i class="fas fa-code"></i>
                <a href="https://github.com/NikosSiak/xbmc/commit/800ef45e7f0dd7caa3ab7dce7aefe165ea39819c" target="_blank">
                    Pictures: ScaleImage changes
                </a>
            </div>

            <p>
                The last week of June the manager looked like this (I was using the dialog for the game clients):
            </p>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="images/savestate_manager_before.png" width="70%">
            </div>

            <p>
                The next step was to change the UI. Here is how the dialog looks now:
            </p>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="images/savestate_manager.jpg" alt="RetroPlayer Save state manager" width="70%">
            </div>

            <h3>In-game save state manager</h3>

            <p>
                While I was working on the save state manager I had a talk with Garrett about creating an in-game manager 
                that looks like the video filter dialog. When I woke up the next day I found a branch whith the UI for
                the in-game manager ready from Garrett. Now I had to populate the item list with the save states for the game
                and load a save state when you click on it.
            </p>

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="images/in_game_savestate_manager.png" alt="RetroPlayer in-game save state manager" width="70%">
            </div>

            <h3>Save state auto-captioning</h3>

            <p>
                To generate captions for save states I used the <a href="http://retroachievements.org/" target="_blank">RetroAchievements</a> API, 
                which besides achievements also returns a rich presence script. To generate the caption from the script I used 
                RetroAchievements <a href="https://github.com/RetroAchievements/rcheevos" target="_blank">rcheevos</a> library. Here is where 
                I faced my biggest challenge of the summer, building <span class="code">game.libretro</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                I started by adding rcheevos as a dependency to game.libretro, then I had to implement the environment callback
                <span class="code">RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_SET_MEMORY_MAPS</span>,
                which is called from the game client code but wasn't doing anything until now, this was needed to calculate the real
                address from the offsets that RetroAchievements returns.
            </p>

            <div class="code-link">
                <i class="fas fa-code"></i>
                <a href="https://github.com/NikosSiak/game.libretro/commit/29d6ef875f97cbc7943e658ccd6241006a9a14ad" target="_blank">
                    game.libretro: Set memory maps
                </a>
            </div>

            <p>
                To evaluate the rich presence string you have to implement a callback function with the signature:
                <div style="text-align: center;">
                <div class="code">typedef unsigned (*rc_peek_t)(unsigned address, unsigned num_bytes, void* ud);</div>
                </div>
                which is used to read from the emulated system's memory. At first I was implementing this (and the whole code that dealt with rcheevos) 
                in Kodi's codebase, but it was reading invalid memory. After a lot of debugging on Kodi and 
                <a href="https://www.retroarch.com/" target="_blank">RetroArch</a> I figured out that this code should go in 
                <span class="code">game.libretro</span> codebase.
            </p>

            <div class="code-link">
                <i class="fas fa-code"></i>
                <a href="https://github.com/NikosSiak/game.libretro/commit/a2cc542acdc4aeb60824830f493104fe298718a9"
                    target="_blank">
                    game.libretro: Evaluate rich presence
                </a>
            </div>
            
            <p> 
                Next I had to add a way for the user to login to their RetroAchievements account, because that is needed in order to get 
                the game data from the API.
                
                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="images/retroachievements_login.jpg" alt="Kodi settings login to RetroAchievements" width="70%">
                </div>

                Finally I had to display the evaluation to the user. For now I just used the save state manager's label field.

                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="images/savestate-manager_with_rp.jpg" alt="RetroPlayer Save state manager" width="70%">
                </div>

                The rich presence evaluation is also displayed to RetroAchievements.
                
                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="images/retroachievements_rp.jpg" alt="Kodi settings login to RetroAchievements" width="70%">
                </div>
            </p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The save state manager sometimes caches the save's thumbnail despite the fact that the thumbnail has been
                        overwritten and displays the previous one.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Because the save states are saved using <a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/" target="_blank">flatbuffers</a> and 
                        they are read-only, so to rename a save state I had to copy the whole file and overwrite the old one, this means that when 
                        the manager sorts the saves it will place this save first.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        Garrett Brown released my save state manager for testers so I would be fixing any bugs they find for

                    <li>
                        A new way to display the rich presence evaluation is needed.

                This was the first time that I contribute to an open-source software. I can say that this experience was awesome, 
                I've learned a ton in just 3 months.
                I really liked the project and it's safe to say I will continue to contribute to Kodi.
